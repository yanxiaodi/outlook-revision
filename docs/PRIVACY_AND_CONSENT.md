# Privacy Policy & User Consent Requirements

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Compliance Overview

**CRITICAL**: This add-in processes user email content through Azure OpenAI, which constitutes processing of potentially sensitive personal data. You **must** implement proper consent mechanisms and privacy disclosures to comply with:

- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation - EU)
- **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act - US)
- **PIPEDA** (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act - Canada)
- **Privacy Act 2020** (New Zealand)
- **Microsoft 365 App Compliance Program**
- **AppSource Certification Requirements**

---

## üö® Current Legal Gaps

### What's Missing:
1. ‚ùå **No user consent mechanism** before sending data to Azure OpenAI
2. ‚ùå **No privacy policy** disclosure
3. ‚ùå **No data processing agreement** visibility
4. ‚ùå **No opt-out mechanism**
5. ‚ùå **No data retention policy**
6. ‚ùå **No data deletion mechanism**

### Legal Risks:
- **GDPR violations**: Fines up to ‚Ç¨20 million or 4% of annual revenue
- **CCPA violations**: Up to $7,500 per intentional violation
- **Microsoft certification rejection**: App won't be approved for AppSource
- **User trust issues**: Loss of credibility and adoption

---

## üìã Required Legal Documents

### 1. Privacy Policy (REQUIRED)

**Location**: Must be publicly accessible (e.g., `https://revision.funcoding.nz/privacy`)

**Must Include**:
- What data is collected (email content, metadata, user email address)
- How data is processed (sent to Azure OpenAI for translation/revision)
- Where data is stored (Azure region, retention period)
- Who has access to data (your organization, Microsoft Azure)
- User rights (access, deletion, opt-out)
- Data security measures
- Contact information for privacy inquiries
- Last updated date

**Template**: See [PRIVACY_POLICY_TEMPLATE.md](#privacy-policy-template) below

---

### 2. Terms of Service (REQUIRED)

**Location**: Must be publicly accessible (e.g., `https://revision.funcoding.nz/terms`)

**Must Include**:
- Acceptable use policy
- Service limitations and disclaimers
- Intellectual property rights
- Limitation of liability
- Termination conditions
- Governing law and jurisdiction

**Template**: See [TERMS_OF_SERVICE_TEMPLATE.md](#terms-of-service-template) below

---

### 3. Data Processing Agreement (RECOMMENDED)

**For Enterprise Customers**: If selling to businesses, they may require a separate DPA

**Must Include**:
- Data processor obligations (your responsibilities)
- Sub-processor disclosure (Azure OpenAI as sub-processor)
- Data security measures
- Data breach notification procedures
- Data subject rights handling
- Audit rights

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Implementation Requirements

### 1. First-Run Consent Dialog

**When**: Before the add-in makes its first API call

**Implementation**: 
```typescript
// Example: Show consent dialog on first use
if (!hasUserConsented()) {
  showConsentDialog({
    title: "Privacy Consent Required",
    message: `
      OutlookReVision uses Azure OpenAI to process your email content.
      
      By using this add-in:
      ‚Ä¢ Your email content will be sent to Microsoft Azure OpenAI
      ‚Ä¢ Data is processed in: [Azure Region]
      ‚Ä¢ Data is not stored permanently
      ‚Ä¢ No data is used for AI training (per Azure OpenAI terms)
      
      [View Privacy Policy] [View Terms of Service]
    `,
    buttons: ["Accept", "Decline"]
  });
}
```

**Must Include**:
- ‚úÖ Clear explanation of data processing
- ‚úÖ Links to full Privacy Policy and Terms
- ‚úÖ Explicit "Accept" action (not pre-checked)
- ‚úÖ "Decline" option (disables add-in)
- ‚úÖ Option to revoke consent later

---

### 2. Settings Panel Consent Management

**Location**: Add-in settings UI

**Features**:
```typescript
// Settings panel checkboxes
- [ ] I consent to Azure OpenAI processing my emails
- [ ] I agree to send usage analytics (optional)

[Revoke Consent] - Disables all AI features
[View Privacy Policy]
[View Terms of Service]
[Delete My Data] - Requests data deletion
```

---

### 3. Manifest Updates

**Add Privacy and Terms URLs** to `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "authorization": {
    "permissions": {
      "resourceSpecific": [
        {
          "name": "MailboxItem.ReadWrite.User",
          "type": "Delegated"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "privacyUrl": "https://revision.funcoding.nz/privacy",
  "termsOfUseUrl": "https://revision.funcoding.nz/terms"
}
```

---

### 4. API Request Headers

**Add transparency headers** to all Azure OpenAI requests:

```typescript
// Example: Add user consent tracking
fetch('/api/Outlook/translate', {
  headers: {
    'X-User-Consented': 'true',
    'X-Consent-Version': '1.0',
    'X-Consent-Date': '2025-01-15T10:30:00Z'
  }
});
```
