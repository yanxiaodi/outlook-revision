# outlook-revision

## Overview

This project is an Outlook add-in that allows users to revise/translate their emails. The add-in will provide a list of actions that the user can take on the email, and then use the OpenAI API to generate a revised version of the email. The user can then choose to send the revised email or save it as a draft.

## Features

* Users can select an email and click on the add-in to revise the email
* Users can translate the email into a different language
* Users can summarize the email
* Users can reply to the email in another language, and the add-in will translate the reply back to the original language
* Users can adjust the tone of the email (e.g. formal, informal, friendly, etc.)
